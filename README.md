<h1>Operating System Simulator for Kids</h1>
<p>The management of processes in an operating system can be compared to the management of orders in a fast-food restaurant. Imagine that the operating system is the restaurant manager, and each process is an order placed by a customer. Just as the manager has to handle multiple orders at once, the operating system must handle multiple processes at the same time. First, the manager takes note of the order and creates an order ticket. Similarly, when the operating system receives a user request to run a program, it creates a process and allocates the necessary resources for its execution. Then, the manager assigns the order to a cook for preparation. Likewise, the operating system assigns the process to a processor for execution. While the order is being prepared, the cook can also prepare other orders at the same time. Similarly, a processor can execute multiple processes simultaneously using multitasking technique. Once the order is ready, the server delivers it to the customer, and the manager marks the order ticket as "completed." Likewise, when the process is finished, the operating system marks the process as "completed" and releases the resources it was occupying. Finally, the manager can manage pending orders, modify their priority, or even cancel an order if necessary. Similarly, the operating system can manage pending processes, modify their priority, or even kill a running process if necessary.
